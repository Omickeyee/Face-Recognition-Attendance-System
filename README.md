## Scope of the project ðŸš€
The scope of a face recognition attendance system includes the following:

- <b>Identification:</b> The system can identify individuals based on their facial features and compare them with a database of known individuals.

- <b>Attendance Tracking:</b> The system can track attendance by identifying individuals and recording their entry and exit times.

- <b>Accuracy:</b> The system must be accurate and reliable in recognizing individuals in various lighting conditions, angles, and poses.
